Quick sort

based on divide and conquer rule

pivot element is chosenby choice...usually first element
for ex in an arr[]={10, 15, 1, 2 , 9, 16, 11};
we partiotion the array into subarrays

we take 10 as the pivot and take all elements less than 10 towards its eft and all greater elements towards its right
siilarly partitions are formed furtherore until the array is sorted.


//next code would be of quick sort
